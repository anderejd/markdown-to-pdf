markdown-to-pdf
===============

A docker file for markdown to pdf convertion, very handy for end-user readme pdf file generation.

To convert this readme you are reading right now execute <./run-example.sh>.

TODO: 
 - Experiment with stdin + stdout.
 - Use docker compose?
 - Use Toast? <https://github.com/stepchowfun/toast>
